Progress log: DefenseBrigadeTD

- Git repository created
- ScalaFX tested
1st meeting
  Next goal: Decide on game world impelemtation and create basis for that implementation.

- Decided to create grid based game world, which consists of squares.
- Created a class Square to represent squares with x and y coordinates (location in the game world), dimensions (square size),
  ground type (high or low) and color (represents the square graphically). (error with Color-type)
- Created a basis for drawing graphics. Draws squares with their representitive colors in their coordinates.
- Created a function that writes generated worldGrid objects into a .json file using upickle.
- Created a function that reads worldGrid objects from .json file using upickle.

7.3. 2nd meeting:

- Basic path generation algorithm created. Enemies can use this path to traverse the gameworld.
- File structure improved.
- Enemy class created and Knight enemy type added.
- Changed aproach to graphics and movements.
