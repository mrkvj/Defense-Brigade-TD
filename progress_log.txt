Progress log: DefenseBrigadeTD

- Git repository created
- ScalaFX tested

1st meeting
  Next goal: Decide on game world impelemtation and create basis for that implementation.

- Decided to create grid based game world, which consists of squares.
- Created a class Square to represent squares with x and y coordinates (location in the game world), dimensions (square size),
  ground type (high or low) and color (represents the square graphically). (error with Color-type)
- Created a basis for drawing graphics. Draws squares with their representitive colors in their coordinates.
- Created a function that writes generated worldGrid objects into a .json file using upickle.
- Created a function that reads worldGrid objects from .json file using upickle.

7.3. 2nd meeting:
  Previous goal reached.
  Next goal: Create enemies that can move in the game world.

- Basic path generation algorithm created. Enemies can use this path to traverse the gameworld.
- File structure improved.
- Enemy class created and Knight enemy type added.
- Changed aproach to graphics and movements.
- Remade base for graphics and movement.
- Map drawn correctly, multiple moving Knight type enemies can be added to the game (no steering yet).

21.3 3rd meeting:
  Previous goal reached.
  Next goal: All basic functionality in the game, game is playable.
  Bonus goal: Aiming for advanced project and early completion.

- Player implemented.
- Goals for steering added.
- Basic steering implemented.
- Losing condition and enemy final goal implemented.
- Basic tower implemented.

21.4. 4th meeting:
  Trying to catch up with the project and try possibly early return.

- Tower shooting functionality added with a timer.
- Projectile class added and various subclasses for different types of projectiles (regular, piercing, homing)
- Predictive aiming and projectile movement added.
- Enemy hitboxes and damaging added.
- Main obeject improved and conditions for game over and restart.
- Media player added for self composed backround music.
- Game object improved and various methods, logic and rigor added.
- Wave generator improved.
- CSV file read/write implemented with sorting for high scores.
- Game infromation and scoreboard displays added.
- Game over screen added.

- Chosing tower added.
- Moving towers added.
- User interface added for the game.
